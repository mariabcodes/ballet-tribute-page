The ballet-tribute-page is a website that was created by me as a tribute to the art of ballet. The website features information about the history of ballet, famous ballet dancers, and ballet companies. The website page is designed to be informative and inspiring, and it is a great resource for anyone who is intrigued with the art form.

**Here are some of the features of the website:**

* A timeline of the history of ballet
* Dancers' training as athletes
* Information about amazing costumes
* A beautiful and elegant design
* Blog-style website page

Created using the HTML, CSS and JavaScript

The website is still under development, but it is already a valuable resource for anyone who loves ballet. 
I encourage you to check it out!
