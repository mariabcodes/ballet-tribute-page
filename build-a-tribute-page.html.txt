  <div class="questions-answers">
  <p class="question" id="question-1">Where did ballet start?</p>
  <p class="answer" id="answer-1">It stems from Italian Renaissance as part of court entertainment. Later on it merged to have two ballet academies in France.</p>
  <p class="question" id="question-2">What is ballet?</p>
  <p class="answer" id="answer-2">It is a theatrical dance that is combined with other artistic elements such as music, constume and stage scenery. The movements tend to have formalised movements and steps.
  <p class="question" id="question-3">What are the most popular ballets?</p>
  <p class="answer" id="answer-3">There are many, but most well-known are Giselle, Swan Lake, Sleeping Beauty, The Nutcraker; and Romeo and Juliet.</p>
  <p class="question" id="question-4">What are the main methods of ballet instruction?</p>
  <p class="answer" id="answer-4">There are many and they differ between schools/teachers. However, the main methods all schools lean towards are: 
    <ul class="methods">
      <li>French School</li>
      <li>Vaganova</li>
      <li>Royal Academy of Dance</li>
      <li>Cecchetti</li>
      <li>Bournonville</li>
      <li>Balanchine</li>
    </ul></p>
  <p class="wording" id="wording">Ahh, very interesting!</p>
  <p class="question" id="question-5">What about costumes? How long do they take to make? </p>

  <figcaption id="img-caption">Ballet formance</figcaption></div>
  <p class="answer" id="answer-5">A singular tutu will take around 80 to 100 hours to be made. For a performance such as Nutcraker, the costume process is five weeks long with three to four people working on 260 costumes. (Do bear in mind the process will vary on the ballet performed, how many characters and dancers there are!)</p>
  <p class="question" id="question-6">So how do ballet dancers go on their toes?</p>
  <p class='answer' id="answer-6">Many dancers go through years of training before they are considered to be ready for 'pointe' (dancing on the tips of toes). Dancers use pointe shoes that allow this, to hold their bodies up on thier toes. These are made out of layers of fabric, cardboard/paper, leather, cotton and satin. There are definitely many layers! The shoes are very rigid but mouldable to dancers' feet over time. </p>
    <p class="question" id="question-7">What about their training? What do they do to train to be ready for pointe?</p>
    <p class="answer" id="answer-7">Dancers often go en pointe around the age of 12. Many have been in ballet since early years, and their technique is strong enough to help when with pointe work. Those that start later would have more to catch up on, but it is most important that they have strength in their bodies (and feel/ankles) to keep them safe and sturdy on their toes.</p>
   <p class="question" id="question-8">Are there any excercises or other trainings that they do to help them prepare?</p>
   <p class="answer" id="answer-8">They are often taught how to use a rubber band exercises, which are done repetitively that help with flexibility and feet strength. Most do several classes each week to help with strength as well, and visit the gym for general body strength and power.</p>
   <p class="question" id="answer-9">That's very cool! What about male dancers? As they don't do pointe do they need to train less?</p>
   <p class="answer" id="answer-9">Some male dancers are encouraged to try pointe work by their teachers to help with their ankle and feet strength during their ballet training. Also, there are up-coming modern companies where male dancers perform in pointe shoes. This is modernising the art form and showing that the pointe shoes are not reserved solely for women.</p>
    <p class="question" id="question-10">This is eye opening! Last question, a fun one - how do dancers not get dizzy with the countless turns that they perform?</p>
    <p class="answer" id="answer-10">That's a great one! They use a technique called 'spotting', where they keep their eyes fixed on a point and return to it when they turn their head. Now you know!</p>
    <p class="wording" id="wording">Thank you for such great information, it's a great dwelve into a mysterious dance form.</p>
